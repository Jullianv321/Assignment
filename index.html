    <h1>CTRL + ALT + CREATE: My Path in IT</h1>
  </header> <hr>


    <p> My name is Jullian Lorono Valdez, a 22-year-old Information Technology student at the University of Cebu. My journey into the tech world began with a simple curiosity and a love for computers and gaming. What started as casual play soon sparked a deeper interest in understanding how technology works behind the scenes. This curiosity grew into a passion for exploring the mechanics of software, hardware, and programming. Though my academic background began in a different field, my fascination with technology motivated me to pursue IT, eager to develop skills that would allow me to create, innovate, and solve problems in the digital age. Every step of the way, I’ve been driven by the desire to learn, grow, and contribute to the ever-changing landscape of technology.</p>

<h2>Breaking Boundaries: A HUMSS Student’s Dive into IT</h2>
</p>Over time, this interest evolved into a deeper fascination with what happens behind the screen—how systems operate, how websites are built, and how code brings ideas to life. Interestingly, my academic path didn’t start in technology; I came from a HUMSS (Humanities and Social Sciences) strand in senior high school, a field that typically doesn’t align with IT. But instead of letting that limit me, I saw it as a challenge—an opportunity to explore something new and grow beyond the boundaries of my previous background. In today’s rapidly evolving world, where tech literacy is nearly essential, I’ve made it a goal to immerse myself in learning and hands-on experience. Inspired by creators and coders on platforms like YouTube, I’ve thrown myself into programming, web development, and practical labs to bridge the gap. While I’m still discovering which specific path in IT I’ll pursue, my drive to learn, adapt, and contribute meaningfully in this digital age continues to push me forward.</p>

<h2>Building Skills Through Practical Experience</h2>
<p>Throughout my lessons, I’ve gained invaluable hands-on experience by actively applying what I’ve learned to personal projects. I’ve utilized C for our computer programming assignments and HTML for web development tasks, continuously building my skills and knowledge. These practical experiences have not only strengthened my technical abilities but also enhanced my problem-solving skills, perseverance, and adaptability. Whether crafting a simple website or experimenting with new tools, I embrace the challenge of transforming ideas into effective solutions. Looking ahead, I’m eager to deepen my expertise in areas like cybersecurity and software development while staying current with the latest industry trends. Ultimately, I aspire to make meaningful contributions to the tech community and drive innovation that positively impacts others.</p>

<h2>My Goals in Information Technology</h2>
<p>In my Information Technology courses, my immediate goal is to ace quizzes well enough to be exempted from prelim exams, which will give me more time and energy to focus on truly understanding the material. Beyond exams, I am committed to deepening my knowledge of coding and programming, as I believe these skills are the backbone of the tech world. I aim to build a strong foundation that will enable me to tackle complex problems and develop innovative solutions in the future.

At the same time, I recognize the importance of balance and self-care. I want to make sure I don’t get burnt out throughout this rigorous program, so I can sustain my passion and motivation over the long haul. This means managing my time effectively, seeking support when needed, and staying mentally and physically healthy.

Ultimately, my biggest aspiration is to become the best version of myself—not only academically but also personally and professionally. I hope to grow into a skilled, confident, and adaptable IT professional who can contribute meaningfully to the technology community and make a positive impact in the world.</p>
